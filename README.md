# QRenamer

A Bulk Renaming Tool for Photographers

## Use-case

QRenamer recognizes QR codes in photos and renames the file and subsequent files to include the data from the QR code.

Let's say you're taking headshots, and need to shoot everyone and record their name. Using QRenamer, each subject can type their name on a tablet to generate a QR code and hold it for their first shot. Later, running QRenamer on the photoset will rename that shot and all subsequent shots to include the subject's name.
