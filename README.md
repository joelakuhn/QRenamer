# QRenamer

A Bulk Renaming Tool for Photographers

## Use-case

Now hear me out. The use-case for this tool is very specific, but if it applies to you, it could be super helpful.

QRenamer recognizes QR codes in photos and renames the file and subsequent files to include the data from the QR code. That's it.

Imagine you're taking headshots for an organization. You want to shoot everyone and record their name at the same time, but changing the file prefix on your DSLR between each shot is time-consuming and error prone. Using QRenamer, each subject can type their name on a tablet to generate a QR code and hold it for their first shot. Later, running QRenamer on the photoset will rename that shot and all subsequent shots to include the subject's name until a new QR code is found.

I hope that makes sense.
